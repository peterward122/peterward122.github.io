# Library Imports

```{r setup, message =FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

We found and acquired this dataset on dataworld.com under the following URL: https://data.world/sports/ncaa-mens-march-madness.

# Data Cleaning

```{r, message = FALSE}
marchmadness <- read_csv('marchmadness.csv')

marchmadness <- marchmadness %>%
  mutate(scoreDiff = `Winning Score` - `Losing Score`) %>%
  mutate(Upset = ifelse(`Losing Seed` < `Winning Seed`, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(UpsetNum = ifelse(`Losing Seed` < `Winning Seed`, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(SeedDiff = abs(`Winning Seed` - `Losing Seed`)) %>%
  mutate(Blowout = ifelse(scoreDiff > 10, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(BlowoutNum = ifelse(scoreDiff > 10, 1, 0))

marchmadness <- marchmadness %>%
  mutate(Upset = as.factor(Upset)) %>%
  mutate(Blowout = as.factor(Blowout)) %>%
  mutate(SeedDiff = as.factor(SeedDiff))

marchmadness <- marchmadness %>%
  mutate(DATE = as.Date(Date, "%m/%d/%y")) %>%
  mutate(year = year(DATE))

head(marchmadness)

## One Number Story Calculations

```{r}
marchmadness %>%
  group_by(Upset) %>%
  summarize(mean(scoreDiff))

marchmadness %>%
  summarize(mean(scoreDiff))

marchmadness %>%
  group_by(Upset) %>%
  count()

```
